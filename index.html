    <h3>Cities I have lived In</h3>
        <p>I was born and raised in Taos, NM. When I graduated from highschool, I packed my car and moved to Denver. 
            after taking some time off, I realized that college was a good idea, so I moved to Boulder to go to CU. 
            It was while I was living there that I recieved a grant to study bangles and their cultural and social significance
            in the lives of Indian women, so I moved to New Delhi. I then moved back to Denver. I got a "real" job and then
            decided that I wanted to move to abroad again and I wanted to work on my spanish. So I sold everything that 
            I owned, bought a ticket and moved to Buenos Aires.

            In the past year, Tokyo has moved up to the top of my list. Istanbul, I've always wanted to visit, but haven't had the chance.
            I want to travel to Naples, because I really want to eat at Antilloâ€™s pizzeria.
